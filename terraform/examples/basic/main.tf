  # This module is now only being tested with Terraform 0.13.x. However, to make upgrading easier, we are setting
  # 0.12.26 as the minimum version, as that version added support for required_providers with source URLs, making it
  # forwards compatible with 0.13.x code.

# The simplest possible Terraform module: it just outputs "Hello, World!"
